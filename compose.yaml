# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker compose reference guide at

# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
# services:
#   server:
#     build:
#       context: .
#     environment:
#       NODE_ENV: production
#     ports:
#       - 9000:9000

# services:
#     frontend:
#       build:
#         context: frontend
#         target: development
#       ports:
